# Hi, I'm Ujaan! 👋


## 🛠️ About Me

I'm a senior year student at HKUST 🇭🇰, pursuing a B.Eng in Computer Engineering. Previously, I was an exchange student at Northwestern University.

- 💻 My interests lie in low-level and embedded development, but lately, I've been exploring language semantics.
- 🧑‍🍳 When I'm not at my laptop, you'll find me cooking or playing on my 3DS (though, let's be honest, I'm usually at my laptop).


## 🔧 Lately I've Been Working On...
1. 🤖 A person-specific following robot for our final year project  
2. 🎹 Custom STM32 keyboard firmware and layouts  
3. 🛠️ Developing an interface for Nix and Nix-adjacent tooling
