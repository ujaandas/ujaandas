## 🛠️ About Me

I'm a senior year student at HKUST 🇭🇰 pursuing a B.Eng in Computer Engineering. Previously, I was an exchange student at Northwestern University.

- 💻 Most of my professional experience lies in the realm of backend development, but my side-projects are mostly embedded/dev-ops.
- 🧑‍🍳 When I'm not at my laptop, you can find me experimenting with recipes or playing on my 3DS (though to be honest, I'm usually glued to my laptop).

## 🍳 Skills
- Languages: C/C++, Python, Java, JavaScript/Typescript, Bash, HTML/CSS, SQL 
- Frameworks: Maven, FastAPI, Next.js, React.js, Node.js
