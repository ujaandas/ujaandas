Hey, I'm Ujaan.

I like Python, Go and Nix. I'm interested in programming languages/analysis, and its intersection with AI. 

I've got professional experience across the whole stack, ranging from frontend development with Next.js, backend microservices with FastAPI, and systems engineering with Java and Python.

In my spare time, I work on my homelab with Nix, random CLI tools in Go/Python, or various low-level embedded/OS projects.
