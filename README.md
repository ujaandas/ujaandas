## 🎯 Hobbies:
- **👨‍🍳 Cooking:** I love eating good food, but my wallet doesn't - so I just make it myself. Currently trying to pick up some more traditional Indian cuisine - send me recipes!
- **⌨️ Mechanical Keyboards:** The pen is mightier than the sword, but my keyboard weighs 2.15kg and will _definitely_ cause more damage than a pen. Currently running a QK75 (all weights, cream, gold knob alongside case, PCB and plate foam) with lubed/filmed (205g0, 105g0) Gateron Oil Kings, Owlstab V2s, with Cherry Milkshake Weirdos on top.
- **🎧 Headphones:** Nothing beats getting back from a long day and plugging in some 2000's rock - running my HD660s off of a FiiO K5 Pro, with the Tangzu Wan'Er or Salnotes 7Hz Zeros for more portable options. 
- **💻 Coding:** You probably could've guessed this one...
