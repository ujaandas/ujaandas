# Hey, I'm Ujaan (Ooj) ðŸ‘‹

I like building stuff when I should probably be studying.

I've worked across a wide range of stacks - from ingesting satellite data for geospatial platforms (web, backend), to writing AST parsers for Java (systems), to building React.js dashboards (frontend).

Lately, I've been enjoying **Go** for backend and systems work. More formally, I have experience across the stack with **Python**, **JS/TS**, **C**, and **Java**.

I'm a published author in **ACM/IUI'24** and **IEEE/ICSE'26**.
