tldr; I like Nix, Python, and JS. I'm interested in programming languages/analysis, and the intersection thereof and AI. 

I have professional experience across the entire stack, ranging from frontend development with Next.js, backend with FastAPI, and systems engineering with Java and Python.

In my spare time, I work on my homelab with Nix, or various low-level embedded/OS projects.
